## About Me

Hello! I am a master's student at Peking University. My research focuses on modeling and analyzing human mobility in urban environments, particularly in relation to urban form and transportation. I place greater importance on revealing and explaining the mechanisms behind human behavior, rather than solely improving model performance for prediction. Therefore, I apply methods such as time series analysis, causal inference, and explainable AI. My interdisciplinary background provides me with a professional perspective on urban studies, engineering thinking, and a solid foundation in mathematics and computer science (I have taken many computer-related courses during my undergraduate and master's studies). 

Currently, I am exploring an interpretable framework for spatiotemporal analysis based on deep learning and causal inference, focusing on time series deconfounding and dynamic causal effects. I welcome any contacts and discussions!

## Research Interests

- **Urban From and Transportation:** interactions between land use and travel behavior, human mobility, traffic congestion
- **Causal Inference:** longitudinal study design, dynamic process, intervention or policy effects
- **Emerging technologies:** deep learning (especially RNN frameworks), explainable AI, large language models in urban science
